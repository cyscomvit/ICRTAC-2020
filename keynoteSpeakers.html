                <p><b>Biography:</b> Xavier Fernando is a Professor at the Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada. He has (co-)authored over 200 research articles, two books (one translated to Mandarin) and holds few patents and non-disclosure agreements. He is the Director of Ryerson Communications Lab (www.ee.ryerson.ca/rcl) that has received total research funding of $3,185,000.00 since 2008 from industry and government (including joint grants. Information about the alumni of this lab is available <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?viewMembers=&gid=3355245&sik=1363101903213">here</a>.He was an IEEE Communications Society Distinguished Lecturer and delivered close over 50 invited talks and keynote presentations all over the world. He was a member in the IEEE Communications Society (COMSOC) Education Board Working Group on Wireless Communications. He was the Chair IEEE Canada Humanitarian Initiatives Committee 2017-18. He was also the Chair of the IEEE Toronto Section and IEEE Canada Central Area. He was the General Chair for IEEE International Humanitarian Technology Conference (IHTC) 2017 and the General Chair of IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE), 2014. He has been in the organizing/steering/technical program committees of numerous conferences and journals. He was a Member of Board of Governors of Ryerson University during 2011-12.He is a program evaluator for ABET (USA). He was a visiting scholar at the Institute of Advanced Telecommunications (IAT), UK in 2008 and MAPNET Fellow visiting Aston University, UK in 2014.

                <p><b>Abstract:</b> Information and communication technologies (ICT) have been changing the way we live. The changes are very significant in recent times. Social media has become a part of our lives and goes way beyond being a fun accessory. It plays a key role in unraveling people power and creating collective opinions even in the US election. The difference between computers, phones, cameras, televisions, audio players and even the bank machine is diminishing as a single device can perform all these tasks and much more. Our kids use more ‘i’ devices than toys. Photonic and radio technologies jointly enable anytime, anywhere, broadband wireless connectivity. Modern wireless technology provides numerous seamless services, from receiving images, video and tweets from the deep space to providing communications and tracking for underground miners. Internet of Things is expanding rapidly. The world is increasingly populated with sensors and connected devices that automatically communicate, make decisions and perform complex tasks. The power grid is getting smarter, self healing and more resilient. Autonomous, electric cars will soon be a common thing, receiving and redelivering electricity to the grid. Our homes will soon generate their own energy and be more interactive. </p>
                <p>However, there are other issues with the ICT as well. Too much reliance on ICT and automation could cause trouble when things malfunction. Management of complex systems and ensuring reliability is generally a demanding task. Privacy and security will always be an issue in a highly automated i-society. Things could get very bad during natural and manmade disasters. On another aspect, the power consumption of ICT equipment is rapidly increasing. That of networks servers was 150 GW in 2007 and expected increase by 300% by 2020. This is another topic that needs attention. In this talk, various cutting-edge technologies towards the realization of an interconnected-society will be highlighted. Their limitations will also be discussed.</p>

Modern wireless technology provides numerous seamless services, from receiving images, video and tweets from the deep space to providing communications and tracking for underground miners. Internet of Things is expanding rapidly. The world is increasingly populated with sensors and connected devices that automatically communicate, make decisions and perform complex tasks. The power grid is getting smarter, self healing and more resilient. Autonomous, electric cars will soon be a common thing, receiving and redelivering electricity to the grid. Our homes will soon generate their own energy and be more interactive. </p>
                <p>However, there are other issues with the ICT as well. Too much reliance on ICT and automation could cause trouble when things malfunction. Management of complex systems and ensuring reliability is generally a demanding task. Privacy and security will always be an issue in a highly automated i-society. Things could get very bad during natural and manmade disasters. On another aspect, the power consumption of ICT equipment is rapidly increasing. That of networks servers was 150 GW in 2007 and expected increase by 300% by 2020. This is another topic that needs attention. In this talk, various cutting-edge technologies towards the realization of an interconnected-society will be highlighted. Their limitations will also be discussed.</p>

                <p><b>Abstract:</b> The omnipresence of social media has many benefits but also downsides. Cyberbullying is one such menace in the online world – it inflicts significant emotional damages on the victims. Although there are many efforts to curb cyberbullying, a vast majority of these either tend to be limited to English and/or are stand-alone in nature. This talk will describe our efforts in detecting cyberbullying behavior in multiple languages, including two Indian languages, using a collaborative framework. The approach uses principles of natural language processing, machine learning, collaborative paradigms, and distributed systems. Various experimental configurations and associated results will be discussed.</p>

                <p><b>Abstract:</b> The fourth industrial revolution, namely Industry 4.0, is a buzz word lately. Industries have established R&D processes, plant operations, supply chains and technologies. Now the industries need to change and improve the sets of processes to remain competitive. Industry 4.0 is a broad term involving modern technologies and processes that can integrate, replace or improve legacy technologies and processes leading to improved productivity. With improvements in productivity and efficiency, the carbon footprint will reduce which in turn will contribute towards sustainability. 

                Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Automation are transforming industries to cyber physical systems. With historical data and insights along preventive maintenance, the entire production line can be visualised, and decisions can be taken autonomously. When industries embrace the Industry 4.0 transformation, skill sets in AI, IoT, Robotics and Automation will dominate, while certain typical job profiles ceasing to exist in the next 5 or 7 years. 

                Increased awareness about Industry 4.0 and sustainability is essential and school curricula need changes to prepare graduates who are future ready. It is hoped that AI, IoT, Robotics and Automation will contribute towards paving the way for a better tomorrow for all. This talk will focus on Industry 4.0 related technologies and the challenges faced by Industry and ahead. That in turn can highlight the need for changes academia and research to prepare for a unique tomorrow.

              <p><b>Abstract:</b> The ethical and societal implications of artificial intelligence systems are a general concern. A possible solution is to have AI systems be trustworthy by being auditable for potential harm by investigators. In this talk, we introduce Z-Inspection, a reference and a process model for AI Ethical maintenance, to help monitor AI systems after deployment, preserve ethical principles, and ensure robustness, from both a technical and social perspective, within the context of given legal and contractual frameworks. The framework is augmented by a Blockchain providing a tamper-resistant log of evidence for the AI/ML model's training and execution. The log provides trustworthy evidence on events and provides non-repudiable evidence during audits. We illustrate the benefits of Trustworthy AI with a case study in healthcare.</p>
